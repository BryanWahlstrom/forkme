Your Task, Should You Accept It
===============================

To show your ability and interest and stuff, we want you to tackle a simple task to show you've got moxie.

What we want you to do is build a single-page website based on the Compass framework.

http://compass-style.org/

Your first challenge might well be getting Compass working, but there are instructions on that website.
Especially helpful if you're on a Mac and are a bit savvy with Terminal.

http://compass-style.org/install/

You will want to **fork** this here repository from GitHub, and get it on your computer.
The button to do so is on the home page of the repo, in the top right,
so that's not too hard if you're logged in.

You're then going to need to get it on your computer.
You'll want a basic understanding of git, I'm afraid.
There are plenty of places on the Internet to get that information,
you'll want to check some out. GitHub has some!

h2. The Goal

Your goal it to make a basic one-page website at `index.html` that demonstrates the following.

1. Has a vertically centered block of content with a tasteful page background.
2. Has a title across the top of that block.
3. Below that, has a row of three equally-sized images.
4. Below that, has a nice big link button.
5. Uses a tasteful pairing of two Google Web Fonts.
6. Uses Compass/SASS in an intellgent way.

Once you're done, send a **pull request** to me. Here's the basics.

When you send that pull request, give me an idea of how long the work took you
and what problems you encountered.
This stuff is never super easy! Just document your thoughts and put them in the notes when you
submit the pull request. That will help me get an idea of where you're at with this stuff.

h2. Why the hassle?

This really is going to help me get an idea of where your at. Honest.
We really don't expect that you're an expert already or anything,
but this will give us some idea of where you're coming from.

If you get completely stuck, we also want to see how you think creatively.
Do you work around it? Do you give up?
How you handle this will probably reflect how you'd actually handle it on the job.

There are a million other factors of course influencing our hiring decisions,
but we hope this will give us an idea of how you tackle new problems,
face challenges, and deal with the frustration that git and sass can cause!

Thanks for taking the time to do this, and we look forward to your awesome pull request!
