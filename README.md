Your Task, Should You Accept It
===============================

To show your ability and interest and stuff, we want you to tackle a simple task to show you've got moxie.

What we want you to do is build a single-page website based on the Foundation framework.

http://foundation.zurb.com/

Your first challenge might well be getting Compass working, which comes as part of the gem that is distributed for Foundation.
The instructions on this page will hopefully help, especially if you're on a Mac and are a bit savvy with Terminal.

You will want to **fork** this repository from GitHub, and get it on your computer.
The button to do so is on the home page of the repo, in the top right, so that's not too hard if you're logged in.

You're then going to need to get it on your computer. You'll want a basic understanding of git, I'm afraid.
There are plenty of places on the Internet to get that information, you'll want to check some out. GitHub has some!

Anyway, your goal is to approximate the PNG image in the root of this repository.
You need to follow the basic grid of Foundation, for which the exmples will be helpful.
You'll want `compass` running, or CodeKit or whatever, to be sure that your SASS is turning into CSS.

Once you're done, send a **pull request** to me. Here's the basics.

When you send that pull request, give me an idea of how long the work took you and what problems you encountered.
This stuff is never super easy! Just document your thoughts and put them in the notes when you
submit the pull request. That will help me get an idea of where you're at with this stuff.

Why the hassle?

This really is going to help me get an idea of where your at. Honest.
We really don't expect that you're an expert already or anything,
but this will give us some idea of where you're coming from.

There are a million other factors of course influencing our hiring decisions,
but we hope this will give us an idea of how you tackle new problems,
face challenges, and deal with the frustration that git can cause!

Thanks for taking the time to do this, and we look forward to your awesome pull request!
